cmd.properties.header = OpenEJB Configuration Properties\n\nThe output of this tool takes all overrideable components OpenEJB sees\nand outputs their properties along with the current value.  This\nallows you to easily see what is running in your system, what\nproperties are available for overriding, and what exact values are for\neach component.  OpenEJB has a number of flags that can be passed to\nit not associated with any particular component, these are output as\nwell.\n\nAny component configured in OpenEJB via the openejb.xml (and some that\naren't) can be overridden using system properties.  The format is:\n\n<id>.<property-name>=<property-value>\n\nContent from this file can be safely copied as-is into the\nconf/system.properties file or sent to the users list with bug\nreports. Note, however passwords are masked. For more details on this\ntool, see http://openejb.apache.org/configuration-properties.html
