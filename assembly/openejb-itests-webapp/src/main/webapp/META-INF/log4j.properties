#  Configuration file for logging in OpenEJB
#
#  OpenEJB uses Apache Log4j to provide logging services
#  to the container system.
#
#  This file configures log4j using the properties file
#  format declared by the class PropertyConfigurator
#
#  For a complete reference on log4j property
#  configuration, visit:
#
#  http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/api/org/apache/log4j/PropertyConfigurator.html
#
#  This file is designated as the log4j configuration file
#  when the system property, log4j.configuration, is set
#  as follows:
#
#  java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:conf/logging.conf
#
#  Any other file could be set as the log4j configuration
#  file using that file name instead.  For example, to
#  set the logging configuration using logging.xml, set
#  the log4j.configuration system property as follows:
#
#  java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:conf/logging.xml
#
#  For more information on specifying log4j configuration
#  files, visit:
#
